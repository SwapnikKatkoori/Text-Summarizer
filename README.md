# text-summarizer
Text-summarizer is a node.js module that summarizes text into a specified number of sentences. This module uses two

different extractive summarization techniques: frequency based and textrank based. It also provides sentiment anylisis on the 

given text, reduction percentage, as well as other information about the text and generated summary. Read the How it Works

section for more 

infromation about the two different approaches used.

<a name="install"></a>
## 1. Install

This package is available through NPM, and can be installed using:

```
npm install -s text-summarizer
```
<a name="usage"></a>
## 2. Quick Start

<a name="init"></a>
### Initialization

To get started, initilize a SummaryManager object.

```
let SummarizerManager = require("text-summarizer").SummarizerManager;

let Summarizer = new SummarizerManager(text_to_summarize,number_of_sentences); 
```
*Params*
- text_to_summarize: is a String of the text you want summarized.

- number_of_sentences: is an Int of how many sentences you want in the summary.

<a name="getsum"></a>
### Gettting a summary

To get a **frequency summary**:

```
let summary = Summarizer.getSummaryByFrequency().summary;
```
- The getSummaryByFrequency() method returns as object. More information on it in the "Method Details" section

To get a **TextRank summary**:

```
let summary;
Summarizer.getSummaryByRank().then((summary_object)=>{
    summary = summary_object.summary;
})
```
- The getSummaryByRank() method returns a Promise. More information on it in the "Method Details" section

<a name="getred"></a>
### Getting a reduction percentage

To get the reduction percentage as a decimal:

```
//If you want the reduction percentage of a frequency summary
let reduction_percentage = Summarizer.getFrequencyReductionAsDec().dec_reduction;

//If you want the reduction percentage of a TextRank summary
let reduction_percentage;
Summarizer.getRankReductionAsDec().then((reduction_obj)=>{
    reduction_percentage = reduction_obj.dec_reduction;
})
```

To get the reduction percentage as a string:

```
//If you want the reduction percentage of a frequency summary
let reduction_percentage = Summarizer.getFrequencyReduction().reduction;

//If you want the reduction percentage of a TextRank summary
let reduction_percentage;
Summarizer.getRankReduction().then((reduction_obj)=>{
    reduction_percentage = reduction_obj.reduction;
})
```

<a name="Sentiment"></a>
### Sentiment Analysis

To get the sentiment value of the string to be summarized:

```
let sentiment = Summarizer.getSentiment();
```

-This will return an Int

<a name="meth"></a>
## 3. Method Details

### getSummaryByFrequency()

Once a SummarizerManager object has been initialized, calling this method will return an object with:

```
{
    summary: "",    //String of the summary
    sentence_list: [],  //List of all of the tokenized sentences in the given text
    weighted_map: Map,  //Map of all of the tokenized words with their frequencies.
    sorted_sentences: []   //A list of all of the sentences sorted by weights.
}
```

### getSummaryByRank()

This method returns a Promise. The result of the Promise is an object with:

```
{
    summary: "",    //String of the summary
    sentence_list: [],  //List of all of the tokenized sentences in the given text
    nouns_and_adjactive_map: Map   //Map of all of the sentences with the values being a list of nouns and adjactives in the                                        sentence
}
```

### getFrequencyReduction()

Once a SummarizerObject has been initialized calling this method will return an object with:

```
{
    reduction: "",  //A String of the percentage of reduction ex. "50.1%"
    summary: ""     //Current frequency summary
    
}
```
-Calling this method without first calling the getSummaryByFrequency() method will still work. It will automatically create
a frequency summary

### getRankReduction()

This method returns a Promise. The result of the Promise is an object with:

```
{
    reduction: "",  //A String of the percentage of reduction ex. "50.1%"
    summary: ""     //Current frequency summary
    
}
```
-Calling this method without first calling the getSummaryByRank() method will still work. It will automatically create
a rank summary

### getFrequencyReductionAsDec()

This method works the same way as getFrequencyReduction and returns an object with:

```
{
    dec_reduction: Float,  //A float of the reduction ex. .50192
    summary: ""     //Current frequency summary
    
}
```

### getRankReductionAsDec()

This method works the same way as getRankReductionAsDec and returns a Promise. The result of the Promise is an object with:

```
{
    reduction: "",  //A String of the percentage of reduction ex. .50192
    summary: ""     //Current frequency summary
    
}
```
-Calling this method without first calling the getSummaryByFrequency() method will still work. It will automatically create
a frequency summary.

## 4. How it Works

### Frequency based algorithm:

This type of summary works best for text that is not too complicated. The advantage of this approach is that it more efficient 

than the textrank implementation. It was heavily inspired by this post https://stackabuse.com/text-summarization-with-nltk-in-python/

- Split the given text into sentences.

- Preprocess the sentences by removing all punctuation and making all letters lowercase.

- Make a list of all the words that occur in the text and find the frequency of the words.

- Take the calculated frequencies of the words and calculate the total weight of the original sentences.


### TextRank based algorithm:

   - Used for tokenizing sentences and sentiment analysis

   - Used to detect nouns and adjectives in a sentence in the TextRank algorithm.
